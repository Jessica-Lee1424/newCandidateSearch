This project serves to demonstrate how to call an API (in this instance, GitHub API) and render data in a browser. In the process, I gained a much deeper understanding of how the .env file interacts with API calls. It tooks several trials and errors to realize I needed to leave my .env in the root file so that vite could access it. When I had it in an environment folder, I kept getting an unathorized error when inspecting the network tab. Taking it out of a folder and saving it to the root allowed the token to be accessed.
